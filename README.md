## Flutter Challenge #1!

## The Mini Challenge

The theme of today's Mini-Challenge isâ€¦ theming (ba dum tss). 

Many apps today include not just a custom theme, but often also a separate light-mode theme and a dark-mode theme. So, this Mini Challenge is about taking the sample [starter app](https://github.com/Flutter-Challenge/mini_challenge_1_starter_app/) and making it shine with your own custom themes.

The app is just one screen. Notably, it has a CustomPaint widget showing a simple picture on it. Below the picture is some text. Finally, there is a radio switch for toggling between dark, light and a third theme.

<img src="assets/light.png" alt="light" width="300"/><img src="assets/dark.png" alt="dark" width="300"/><img src="assets/other.png" alt="other" width="300"/>

Your Challenge is to make this screen more interesting with custom themeing. A completed challenge app includes:
- a custom TextTheme in the app's ThemeData for light and dark modes. (check out my_theme.dart to get started on this)
- a custom color for the AppBar and the text area's background for light and dark modes (again, check out my_theme.dart to get started on this).
- a custom Widget theme for the CustomPaint widget for light and dark modes (check out custom_themes.dart to get started on this)]
- Not required, but encouraged: theming, as above, for the third theme as well.
