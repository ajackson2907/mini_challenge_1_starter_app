## Flutter Challenge #1!

<img src="assets/light.png" alt="light" width="250"/><img src="assets/dark.png" alt="dark" width="250"/><img src="assets/other.png" alt="other" width="250"/>

Your Challenge is to make this screen more interesting with custom themeing. A completed challenge app includes:
- a custom TextTheme in the app's ThemeData for light and dark modes. (check out my_theme.dart to get started on this)
- a custom color for the AppBar and the text area's background for light and dark modes (again, check out my_theme.dart to get started on this).
- a custom Widget theme for the CustomPaint widget for light and dark modes (check out custom_themes.dart to get started on this)]
- Not required, but encouraged: theming, as above, for the third theme as well.
